            GridStreak pioneers clean energy grid stabilization through our
            innovative thermal brick technology that converts plastic waste into
            renewable energy storage.
            <br /><br />
            Our carbon-negative solution empowers businesses and governments to
            balance grid frequency, eliminate fossil fuel backups, and divert
            plastic from landfills — all while cutting costs by 40%.
            <br /><br />
            As the only energy storage system integrating waste-to-energy
            pyrolysis, long period thermal storage, and instant grid response,
            we’re redefining how the world achieves zero-carbon grid resilience
            from small scale to large scale industrial use.
